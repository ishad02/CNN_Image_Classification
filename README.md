# Image Classification Using CNN

Developed an image classification system for five classes with a dataset of 2400 images (1720 training, 430 validation, 250 test). Addressed dataset imbalance using techniques like undersampling and oversampling. Evaluated models including Logistic Regression, Neural Network, AlexNet, ResNet-34, Inception Net, and Custom CNN Model.
